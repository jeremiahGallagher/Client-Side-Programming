        <h2>Syntax Errors</h2>
        <p>Syntax errors occur whenever the script interpreter you are using does
          not recognize a specific portion of code.  These errors are commonly caused
          by mispelled words or missing symbols.  They can also be caused by trying to use
          methods and functions that do not exist. Because Javascript is an interpreted
          language, syntax errors may not be recognized until the program tries to
          execute.  Some modern text-editing software, like Atom and Notepad++ are
          equipped with tools that help to spot common syntax mistakes as they are written.
          Syntax errors are easiest to find early on before you have a large amount of code to search
          in order to find them.  Therrefore, my prefered method is to go back
          every few lines and double check for spelling and oter syntax errors.
        </p>
        <h2>Run-Time Errors</h2>
        <p>Run-Time Errors may occur while a javascript program is executing. They are
          different from syntax errors in that they may be caused by syntax errors.
          Run-Time errors occur when the interpreter is executing a program and tries to execute
          code that it cannot.  The root of the issue may be a syntax error, or an
          error caused by misplaced code elements, like local variables that should be global, and
          vice versa.  Run-Time Errors are relatively easy to isolate since the console
          will log the line at which the error occured in the code, and the type of
          error that occured.
        </p>
        <h2>Logic Errors</h2>
        <p> Logic Errors occur when you write code that functions in ways you did not
          intend.  Logic Errors do not necessarily create Run-Time Errors, but will still
          give undesired results.  Because of this, Logic Errors are often the hardest to find and
          correct.  One exemple of a logic error might be an infinite loop programmed
          into a function.  This happens when a function never meets the requirements
          it has to break out of the loop it cycles while performing a task.  These types of errors
          are best found by knowing what the intended outputs of a program are
          supposed to be.  If you do not get the desired output from a specific Calculation
          or other method, you can isolate the error to that method, or its related methods and fix
          the error.
